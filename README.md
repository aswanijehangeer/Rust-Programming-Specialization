## Introduction

A repository dedicated to coursework, projects, and exercises completed during the Rust programming specialization from Duke University on Coursera.

## Courses

There are a total of five courses in this Specialization.

## Course 1: Rust Fundamentals

Throughout the course, you will gain a solid foundation in Rust programming and develop proficiency in advanced concepts, enabling you to write efficient, reliable, and high-performance code. You will understand the core concepts and syntax of Rust, learn effective code organization, error handling techniques, and explore Rust's package manager for efficient project management.

**Modules:**

- Installing Rust and Setting Up Your Text Editor.
- Rust Fundamentals.
- Using Structs, Types, and Enums.
- Applying Rust.

## Course 2: Data Engineering with Rust

This four-week course focuses on leveraging Rust to create efficient, safe, and concurrent data processing systems. The journey begins with a deep dive into Rust's data structures and collections, followed by exploring Rust's safety and security features in the context of data engineering. In the subsequent week, you'll explore libraries and tools specific to data engineering like Diesel, async, Polars, and Apache Arrow, and learn to interface with data processing systems, REST, gRPC protocols, and AWS SDK for cloud-based data operations. The final week focuses on designing and implementing full-fledged data processing systems using Rust.

**Modules:**

- Rust Data Structres: Collections
- Safety, Security and Concurrency with Rust.
- Rust Data Engineering Libraries and Tools.
- Designing Data Processing Systems with Rust.

## Course 3: Rust for DevOps

This course is for you if you have beginner level programming experience and are familiar with Linux, Git, and Docker fundamentals.

Through video lessons and coding exercises, you will gain practical Rust skills to build, deploy, and monitor applications using DevOps workflows. You will implement containerization, instrument your code for observability, and automate common administration tasks like file parsing and cron jobs. By the end, you will have the Rust and DevOps skills to rapidly develop robust large-scale applications, regardless of your specific technical role.

**Modules:**

- DevOps Fundamentals.
- Implementing logging and monitoring strategies.
- Automating System management.
- CI/CD Platforms.

## Course 4: Python and Rust with Linux Command Line Tools

This course is designed for beginners and those with some programming experience in either Python or Rust that want to implement automation and utilities in the command-line.

Although no prior knowledge of Python or Rust is required, basic programming knowledge is recommended as well as some familiarity with the command-line interface (CLI). Throughout the course, you will gain a solid foundation for building efficient, reliable, and high-performance command-line tools that can help you automate tasks for data engineering, systems engineering, and DevOps. By completing this course, you will have the skills to develop and distribute sophisticated and efficient command-line tools.

**Modules:**

- Introduction to Command-line tools with Python and Rust.
- Advance Command-line tool development.
- Using Rust with Python.
- Rust AWS Lambda.

## Course 5: Rust for Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps)

Do you aspire to be a Rust developer at the forefront of the AI revolution?

This groundbreaking course is designed specifically to train you in Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps) using Rust. This course doesn't just scratch the surface; it takes a deep dive into how you can integrate Rust with sophisticated LLM frameworks like HuggingFace Transformers. We'll also explore how to effectively deploy these large models on cloud infrastructures such as AWS, all while incorporating DevOps methodologies tailored for LLMOps.

**Modules:**

- DevOps Concepts for MLOps.
- Rust Hugging Face Candle.
- Key LLMOps Technologies.
- Key Generative AI Technologies.
